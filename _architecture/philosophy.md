The way we think

First and foremost, we are not an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). While MassTransit is used in several enterprises it isn’t a swiss army knife, we are not driven by sales to be a million features wide, and an inch deep. We focus on a few key concepts and try to make them as robust as possible.

We don’t do doodleware, you won’t find a designer, we are all about the keyboard samurais, the true in-the-trenches coder. That’s who we are, and those are our friends. If you want to draw, use a whiteboard.

We don’t do FTP->WS-deathstar->BS (not that you can’t, its just not in the box). We focus on the experience of using one transport in a given environment, and we try to make it as smooth as possible.

MassTransit is built to be used inside the firewall, its not built to be used as a means to communicate with external vendors (it can be, again its just not in the box), its meant to be used for getting your corporate services talking to each other and making building internal software easier.
